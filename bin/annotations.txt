For the first level, all of application which are installed on the device have the same blacklist of permission. For example, 3G network permission could be added to the blacklist, and no apps can use 3G data. For the second level, IT can apply the blacklist of permissions to each applications with this implementation. For instance, 'A' application is restricted to use 3G networks and Bluetooth, and 'B' application can be restricted to use Bluetooth and Microphone. The applications 'A' and 'B' can have differetent policy for the restriction.

EDMProxy : EDMProxy is a part of MDM services which specifies the real implementation such as managing policy DB, and controling the device's behavior. As the functionalities increases, the number of methods in frameworks.jar exceeds the limitation. This causes build breaks and system unstability. Some modules which carry amount of methods like EDM (Enterprise Device Manager) are expected to move out from frameworks.jar to an individual library. To do this, the module being supposed to move should have the one-way reference to frameworks.jar, not cross reference. EDMProxy has to be designed to keep a part of APIs which has cross reference with frameworks.jar. And, EDMProxy Service specifies the real implementation of EDMProxy APIs. Other part can stay with the existing structure of services matching with APIs.

kioskmode : This service has been added to support a feature to extremely lockdown the device such as HW keys, HOME key, task managers and more functions on the device. This feature can make the device a kiosk, menu board, or cachier for the user to have very restricted access on the device. And, another use case for this feature could be used to protect the device from the theft. Once MDM server issues the policy, the device looks like being bricked, but it is still alive. This mode is definitely useful to track the location of the thefted device.
