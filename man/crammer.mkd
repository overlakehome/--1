##### non-technical prep

* go in humble, open-minded, and focused on interview survival.
* never tell interviewers how to interview - most arrogant.
* feel free to ask for help or hints when stuck on hurdles.
* do not change the subject or answer a different question.
* ask if they want us to write some code on the whiteboard.
* ask if they really care about syntax and want clean code.
* ask clarifying questions and verify if it's on the track.
* be cautious of a delay-of-game penalty if taken too long.

##### technical prep

* absolutely know how hashtable, hashmap, and treemap work.
* a binary search tree, B-tree, B+ tree, trie/suffix tree, red/black, splay, and AVL tree.
* in a B+ tree, in contrast to a B-tree, all records are stored at the leaf level of the tree; only keys are stored in interior nodes.
  * the primary value of a B+ tree is in storing data for efficient retrieval in a block-oriented storage context; this is primarily because unlike binary search trees, B+ trees have very high fanout (typically on the order of 100 or more), which reduces the number of I/O operations required to find an element in the tree.
* [graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_traversal) & [tree traversals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal): DFS, BFS, inorder, preorder, and postorder.
* graph algos: [Dijkstra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm), [A*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm), ...
  * A* uses a distance-plus-cost heuristic function to determine the order where we visit nodes in a combinatorial space search.
  * The distance-plus-cost heuristic is a sum of two functions: the path-cost function, and an admissible "heuristic estimate" of the distance to the goal.
* [NP-complete](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-complete): TSP, hamiltonian path, knapsack, vertex cover, graph coloring, ...
* discrete math: 
  * a _k_-combination of a set S is a subset of _k_ distinct elements of S, and the # of k-combinations is equals to the binomial coefficient, <b>n! / (k! * (n-k)!)</b>.
  * a _k_-permutation of a set S is an ordered sequence of k distinct elements of S, and the # of _k_-permutation of n objects is denoted variously <sub>n</sub>P<sub>k</sub>, P<sub>n,k</sub>, and P(n,k), and its value is given by <b>n! / (n-k)!</b>.
  * [how many ways are there to merge N companies](http://placementsindia.blogspot.jp/2007/12/solutions-to-few-google-top-interview.html)? `C(n,2)*C(n-1,2)*...*C(2,2) = n!*(n-1)!/(2**(n-1))`
* OS: processes & threads, locks, ciritical sections, and monitors
  * a deadlock is a situation wherein two or more competing actions are waiting for the other to finish, so neither ever does.
  * a livelock occurs when 2+ processes continually change their state in response to changes in the other processes, so neither ever finishes.
  * the necessary deadlock conditions: mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, whereas the sufficient deadlock condition: circular wait.
  * a semaphore allows synchronized access to an arbitrary number of shared resource, whilst a mutex allows synchronized access to a shared resource. a mutex has two states: locked/unlocked, unavailable/available. a semaphore has a counter.

##### questions

* design put and get methods on a fixed size cache w/ LRU eviction strategy.
* debug a crashing process, or a crash dump: unchecked exceptions such as divide-by-zero, out-of-memory, out-of-system resources, and array out-of- index range, heap/stack overflow, and unallocated/uninitialized/corrupted memory.
* design database tables for a car rental app.
* design a class library for a generic card game.
* design a data structure for managing memory (stack).
* design a system that produces top 1M google search terms.
* organize a closet full of t-shirts for easier retrievals.
* design a function that sees if one won a Tic Tac Toe game.
* store a binary search tree into an array efficiently.
* find the k-th largest element from a binary search tree w/o extra space use.

```ruby
def self.last(node, k, a = [0]) # solves the k-th largest element.
  if node
    (a[0] < k ? last(node.right, k, a) : []) +
    (a[0] < k ? [node.value] : []) +
    ((a[0] += 1) < k ? last(node.left, k, a) : [])
  else
    []
  end
end
```
* find the minimum # of coins to give a certain amount of change.

```ruby
def self.make_change(k, denominations, memos = {0 => []})
  denominations.select {|d| d <= k}.map {|d|
    [d] + (memos[k-d] ||= make_change(k-d, denominations, memos))
  }.min_by { |coins| coins.size }
end
```
* design an index structure for anagrams of words? e.g. 'pot' is returned when 'top' is queried.
* design a search engine. how to index keywords out of documents?
* design spelling and word suggestions for smartphone keyboards.
* find the max rectangle in terms of area from a histogram in linear time, O(n).
* design a 2D dungeon crawling game; a maze full of walls, objects, and characters.
* design a Frogger game; we should direct a frog to avoid cars while crossing a busy road.
* find integers that appear at least twice given a file of 4B 32-bit integers.
* construct Google maps from scratch, and guide a person stadning at Mumbai to Delhi.

#### Concurrent Puzzle Solver

* We define a puzzle where there are an initial state, a goal state, and a set of rules that determine valid moves. The concurrent approach uses the work queue of the executor instead of a call stack to hold the search state. Sequential approach performs DFS, that is bounded by the thread stack size, whereas concurrent approach performs BFS, that is still bounded by the set of states to be searched, or already searched.

```java
public List<M> ConcurrentPuzzleSolver#solve() throws InterruptedException {
    try {
        P initial = puzzle.initialState();
        exec.execute(newTask(initial, null, null));
        Node<P, M> solution = solutionLatch.getValue();
        return null == solution ? null : solution.asMoves();
    } finally {
        exec.shutdown();
    }
}
```

#### Crammer

OO design
- singleton, factory, adapter, bridge, visiter, command, proxy, observer

Database
- how relational db works, design schemas, and write basic queries

Distributed computing
- map-reduce, service oriented architecture, distributed caching, and load balancing

```javascript
function m() {
   for (var i = 0; i < this.reviews.lenghts; i++) {
      emit (this.reviews[i].who, { count: 1, length: this.reviews[i].text.length });
   }
}

function r(who, values) {
   var res = { count: 0, length: 0 }
   for (var i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
      res.count += vales[i].count;
      res.length = += values[i].length;
   }

   return res;
}

function f(who, value) {
   value.average = value.length / value.count;
   return value;
}

reduced = db.reviews.mapReduce(m, r, f);
db[reduced.results].find();
```

Lock-ordering deadlocks can be eliminated by fixed global order, or identity hash code, not calling alien methods, and strive to open calls. Detection and avoidance?

highly coupled dependency -> setter injection, interface injection, and constructor injection.
